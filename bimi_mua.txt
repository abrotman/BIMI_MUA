                       BIMI on an Independent MUA
                       draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method by which a receiving MTA may insert
   Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) headers into a
   message in such a way that a third party MUA can not only use the
   information in those headers but also validate that the headers were
   inserted by the MTA.

1.  Introduction

   Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) describes a method
   to enable Domain Owners to coordinate with Mailbox Providers (MBPs),
   Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs), and Mail User Agents (MUAs) in the
   display of brand-specific Indicators (e.g., logos) next to properly
   authenticated messages.

   BIMI relies on DMARC, which in turn relies on both SPF and DKIM
   validation for the message in question, and it is generally accepted
   that an MTA is best positioned to do the SPF and DKIM validation that
   underpin DMARC, since it has the cleanest access to the data
   necessary for such validation.  An MUA almost certainly cannot
   perform SPF validation on a message, as it will not know the sending
   IP of the message, and an MUA could only perform DKIM validation on a
   message if the MTA has not altered the DKIM-protected parts of the
   message.  This makes the simplest path to the display of a BIMI
   Indicator one where the MTA performs the required checks for DMARC
   and BIMI and records the results of those checks in a way that can be
   accessed by the MUA.

   BIMI makes no requirement that the MTA handling a message and the MUA
   reading and displaying it be operated by the same entity.  In cases
   where a mailbox holder uses their MBP's MUA to read the contents of
   their mailbox, it is a relatively simple matter for the MTA and MUA
   to interoperate in a way in which the display of the BIMI Indicator
   can be controlled by the MBP.

   What is less simple is the interoperability between an MBP's MTAs and
   message stores and a third-party MUA.  In this scenario, there must
   exist a standard way for an MTA to communicate BIMI and DMARC
   validation results to the MUA in a way that can be verified by the
   MTA.  In addition, the MBP through its message store must be able to
   indicate that a BIMI Indicator and/or its Evidence Document has been
   revoked if circumstances require.

   This document describes a method for achieving interoperability
   between an MBP's MTAs and message stores and a third-party MUA.

2.  Validation Information

   The receiving entity may add two headers, BIMI-Location and BIMI-
   Indicator.  These two headers are meant to aid the MUA with the
   location of the BIMI-related information, as well as base64-encoded
   SVG image file.

   Additionally, a receiver employing this method MUST add another
   header to the message, BIMI-Receiver-Information.  This will contain
   a "date-time" (from [RFC5322]), and sha256-encoded hash from the
   local part of the recipient, and then the "domain" (again from
   RFC5322)

   BIMI-Receiver-Information: date: date-time ; rcpt: sha256-local @
   domain

   date-time: RFC5322

   domain: RFC5322

   sha256-local: 64( HEXDIG )

   An example might be:

   BIMI-Receiver-Information: date: Tue, 25 Oct 2022 01:05:55 +0000 ;
   rcpt: 6d9010b2b7a1483b256ae7477738dba7c530bd9ba53db1d6691441e74b83608
   a@isp.net

3.  BIMI-Receiver-Signature

   The MTA or other entity that performed the BIMI validation of the
   message MUST, if the message passed all BIMI validation checks,
   insert a BIMI-Receiver-Signature header constructed in a manner
   consistent with the creation of a DKIM-Signature header as defined in
   [RFC6376].  This header MUST include all the BIMI-Location, BIMI-
   Selector, and BIMI-Receiver-Information headers as headers that were
   signed by this signature.

RFC draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00   BIMI-MUA                   February 2023


   This signature will be validated by the MUA in the same manner that a
   DKIM-Signature header is validated, and successful validation of this
   header will indicate that the signing domain inserted the signed
   headers.

   The public key to support this signing activity will be published in
   the DNS at a location one or more levels below the name
   "_bimi.signingDomain".  For example, an MBP named "isp.net" might
   publish its public key at "sel_sign._bimi.isp.net".  For the purposes
   of this document, we will refer to "sel_sign" as the "True Selector".

   The selector specified in the s= tag of this signature will be a
   pseudo-selector constructed by prepending the full domain from the
   RFC5322.From header to the "True Selector".  In the INFORMATIVE
   EXAMPLE of a BIMI-Receiver-Signature header shown below, the s= tag
   is assigned the value "marketing.example.org.sel_sign", which means
   that the RFC5322.From header for the message contained the domain
   "marketing.example.org".

   BIMI-Receiver-Signature: v=BIMI1; d=isp.net;
   s=marketing.example.org.sel_sign; c=canonicalization; h=BIMI-
   Location:BIMI-Selector:BIMI-Receiver-Information; b=<SIGNATURE_BLOB>;
   t=timestamp

3.1.  Public Key Publishing

   While the above method describing "pseudo-selectors" might seem to
   require that isp.net publish an infinite number of DKIM public keys
   in order to support validation of its BIMI-Receiver-Signature
   headers, that is not the case.  Instead, validation of these
   signature headers will rely on publishing a DNS wildcard record,
   while revocation of BIMI logos will rely on the publishing of empty
   records to match the domains for which the MBP no longer wishes to
   support validation of BIMI logos.

   As mentioned in the previous section, the MBP will publish its public
   key for supporting validation of BIMI-Receiver-Signatures at the name
   matching this pattern:

   <True Selector>._bimi.<signing Domain>

   In the example above that would mean publishing a DKIM public key as
   follows:

   sel_sign._bimi.isp.net TXT "v=BIMI1; p=<public_key_data>"

RFC draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00   BIMI-MUA                   February 2023


   To support validation of its signatures where the selector is the
   "pseudo-selector" described in the previous section, the MBP will
   also publish the following DNS wildcard record:

   *.sel_sign._bimi.isp.net CNAME sel_sign._bimi.isp.net.

4.  Revocation

   There could exist any number of reasons for a receiving entity to no
   longer desire to display iconography for a given sending domain.
   This could include certificate revocation from the CA, diminished
   local reputation, extensive abuse reports, or anything else.

   In the case where this happens, the MBP (again, isp.net) can publish
   a NULL record at the location where the domain would normally match a
   wildcard.  If we also use "example.net", this may look like this:

   example.net.sel_sign._bimi.isp.net TXT "v=BIMI1;"

   The important part is that the DNS response does not include a
   functional public key that could be used to validate the signature.

   This would ensure the MUA is no longer able to retrieve the public
   keys necessary to validate the signature.  In this case, it should no
   longer utilize the headers, even though they do still exist in the
   stored message.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Key Separation

   The key used to sign these BIMI headers should not be shared with
   another portion of the receiving platform.

5.2.  Header Removal

   Any MBP receiving these headers intact should remove these and
   perform their own evaluations.

6.  Appendix A

   For purposes below, sending is "example.com", MBP is "isp.net", and
   selector is "sel_sign".
