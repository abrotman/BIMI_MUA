                       BIMI on an Independent MUA
                       draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method by which a receiving MTA may insert
   Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) headers into a
   message in such a way that a third party MUA can not only use the
   information in those headers but also validate that the headers were
   inserted by the MTA.

1.  Introduction

   Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) describes a method
   to enable Domain Owners to coordinate with Mailbox Providers (MBPs),
   Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs), and Mail User Agents (MUAs) in the
   display of brand-specific Indicators (e.g., logos) next to properly
   authenticated messages.

   BIMI relies on DMARC, which in turn relies on one of SPF or DKIM
   validation for the message in question, and it is generally accepted
   that an MTA is best positioned to do the SPF and DKIM validation that
   underpin DMARC since it has the access to the data necessary for such
   validation.  An MUA almost certainly cannot perform SPF validation on

   a message, as it will not know the sending IP of the message (short
   of attempting to interpret Received headers), and an MUA could only
   perform DKIM validation on a message if the MTA has not altered the
   DKIM-protected parts of the message.  This makes the simplest path to
   the display of a BIMI Indicator one where the MTA performs the
   required checks for DMARC and BIMI and records the results of those
   checks in a way that can be accessed by the MUA.

   BIMI makes no requirement that the MTA handling a message and the MUA
   reading and displaying it are operated by the same entity.  In cases
   where a mailbox holder uses their MBP's MUA to read the contents of
   their mailbox, it is a relatively simple matter for the MTA and MUA
   to interoperate in a way in which the display of the BIMI Indicator
   can be controlled by the MBP.

   What is less simple is the interoperability between an MBP's MTAs and
   message stores and an independent, or third-party, MUA.  In this
   scenario, there must exist a standard way for an MTA to communicate
   BIMI and DMARC validation results to the MUA in a way that can be
   verified by the MUA.  In addition, the MBP through its message store
   may desire to be able to indicate that a BIMI Indicator and/or its
   Evidence Document has been revoked if circumstances require.

   This document describes a method for achieving interoperability
   between a MBP's MTAs and message stores, and a third-party MUA.
   Without this link, an attacker could potentially insert messages with
   existing headers through some other means, SMTP and IMAP are examples
   here.  Using this verifiable method allows for the MUA to understand
   the validation at the MTA layer.

2.  Validation Information

   The receiving entity may add two headers, BIMI-Location and BIMI-
   Indicator.  These two headers are meant to aid the MUA with the
   location of the BIMI-related information, as well as base64-encoded
   SVG image data.  They could also insert an Authentication-Results
   header at this stage.

   Additionally, a receiver employing this method MUST add another
   header to the message, BIMI-Receiver-Information.  This will contain
   a date-time (from [RFC5322]), and sha256-encoded hash from the local
   part of the recipient, and then the domain (From the RFC5321 RCPT TO
   command):

   BIMI-Receiver-Information: date: date-time ; rcpt: sha256-local @
   domain

   date-time: RFC5322

RFC draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00   BIMI-MUA                  September 2023


   domain: RFC5321

   sha256-local: 64( HEXDIG )

   An example might be:

   BIMI-Receiver-Information: date: Tue, 25 Feb 2023 01:05:55 +0000 ;
   rcpt: 6d9010b2b7a1483b256ae7477738dba7c530bd9ba53db1d6691441e74b83608
   a@isp.net

   A MBP may choose to add this data without the signature specified
   below.  However, as the data cannot be verified via the signature,
   the MUA may find the data within the header unsatisfactory to be
   used.

   NOTE: Changed to 5321, instead of 5322

3.  BIMI-Receiver-Signature

   The MTA or other entity that performed the BIMI validation of the
   message MUST, if the message passed all BIMI validation checks,
   insert a BIMI-Receiver-Signature header constructed in a manner
   consistent with the creation of a DKIM-Signature header as defined in
   [RFC6376].  This header MUST include all the BIMI-Location, BIMI-
   Selector, and BIMI-Receiver-Information headers as headers that were
   signed by this signature.  Additionally, the signer should oversign
   the headers included as part of this signature as defined in
   [RFC6376].

   CLARIFICATION: Is this Receiver-Signature header useful without the
   other headers?  Today, not all MBPs insert these headers.  Can this
   still be useful?

   This signature will be validated by the MUA in the same manner that a
   DKIM-Signature header is validated, and successful validation of this
   header will indicate that the receiving domain inserted the signed
   headers.

   The public key to support this signing activity will be published in
   the DNS at a location one or more levels below the name
   "_bimi.signingDomain", where "signingDomain" is the domain associated
   with the address in the RCPT TO command.  By utilizing a different
   "namespace", this prevents this particular key from being used in
   DKIM Replay attacks.  For example, an MBP named "isp.net" might
   publish its public key at "sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net".  For the
   purposes of this document, we will refer to "sel_sign" as the "True
   Selector".

   The selector specified in the s= tag of this signature will be a
   pseudo-selector constructed by prepending the FQDN domain from the
   the BIMI discovery to the "True Selector".  In the INFORMATIVE
   EXAMPLE of a BIMI-Receiver-Signature header shown below, the s= tag
   is assigned the value "marketing.example.org.sel_sign", which means
   that the BIMI information for the message was found at the domain
   "marketing.example.org".

   DISCUSS: Terminology around which domain is used above, and how we
   reference it.

   DISCUSS: Other headers?  Other information?

   BIMI-Receiver-Signature: v=BIMI1; d=isp.net;
   s=marketing.example.org.sel_sign; c=canonicalization; h=BIMI-
   Location:BIMI-Selector:BIMI-Receiver-Information; b=<SIGNATURE_BLOB>;
   t=timestamp

   The public key used for validation by the MUA would be:

   marketing.example.org.sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net

   The mechanics of the public key publishing are covered in sections
   below.

3.1.  Public Key Publishing

   While the above method describing "pseudo-selectors" might seem to
   require that isp.net publish an infinite number of DKIM public keys
   in order to support validation of its BIMI-Receiver-Signature
   headers, that is not the case.  Instead, validation of these
   signature headers will rely on publishing a DNS wildcard record,
   while revocation of BIMI logos will rely on the publishing of empty
   records to match the domains for which the MBP no longer wishes to
   support validation of BIMI logos.

   As mentioned in the previous section, the MBP will publish its public
   key for supporting validation of BIMI-Receiver-Signatures at the name
   matching this pattern:

   <True Selector>._local._bimi.<signing Domain>

   In the example above that would mean publishing a DKIM public key as
   follows:

   sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net TXT "v=BIMI1; p=<public_key_data>"





Brotman                   Expires 6 March 2024                  [Page 5]

RFC draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00   BIMI-MUA                  September 2023


   To support validation of its signatures where the selector is the
   "pseudo-selector" described in the previous section, the MBP will
   also publish the following DNS wildcard record:

   *.sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net CNAME sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net.

   When the MUA performs a lookup, the wildcard MUST match and provide
   the MUA with the proper public key to validate the signature.

4.  MUA Validation

   NOTE: Stub, needs elaboration

   As with DKIM, the MUA will use the cryptographic signature to
   validate the protected contents.  Additionally, the MUA may use a
   sha-256 hash to validate the message and signature are meant for the
   recipient using the MUA.  By validating the recipient, this could aid
   with replay protection.

5.  Revocation

   There could exist any number of reasons for a receiving entity to no
   longer desire to display iconography related to a given sending
   domain.  This could include certificate revocation from the CA,
   diminished local reputation, extensive abuse reports, certificate
   expiration, or anything else.

   In the case where this happens, the MBP (again, isp.net) can publish
   a NULL record at the location where the domain would normally match a
   wildcard.  The MBP may optionally choose to include a string as to
   the reason for revocation by utilizing the r tag in the record.  If
   we also use marketing.example.org with a selector of "foo", this MUST
   appear as:

   foo._s.marketing.example.org.sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net TXT
   'v=BIMI1;' foo._s.marketing.example.org.sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net
   TXT 'v=BIMI1;"r=Reason String;"'

   The DNS response MUST not include a functional public key that could
   be used to validate the signature.  If compared to the wildcard DNS
   entry defined earlier, there will no longer be a public key that can
   be used for validation.  The DNS record MUST contain only a v tag,
   MAY contain an optional r tag, and MUST NOT contain a p (public key)
   tag.

RFC draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00   BIMI-MUA                  September 2023


   This should ensure the MUA is no longer able to retrieve the public
   keys necessary to validate the signature.  In this case, the MUA MUST
   NOT utilize the headers, even though they do still exist in the
   stored message.

   See the Appendix for how revocation would look in practice.

5.1.  Wildcard Revocation

   Three situations could exist here.  A MBP would like to revoke
   multiple third-level domains for a single apex domain.  Another could
   be that the MBP would like to rotate older keys.

5.1.1.  Multi-domain Revocation

   In a case where the domain example.org sends messages as:

   marketing.example.org
   billing.example.org

   And the MBP would like to revoke for the entirety of example.org, a
   wildcard record could be published to match multiple:

   example.org.sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net TXT 'v=BIMI1;'
   *.example.org.sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net TXT 'v=BIMI1;'

5.1.2.  Multi-selector Revocation

   If the MBP would prefer to revoke all selectors for a given domain,
   it could be published with a wildcard:

   *._s.marketing.example.org.sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net TXT
   'v=BIMI1;'

5.1.3.  Public Key Revocation/Rotation

   The MBP could determine that an older key needs to be retired.  In
   this case the MBP could either remove the DNS record, or continue
   publishing without a valid public key attached:

   sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net TXT 'v=BIMI1;'
   *.sel_sign._local._bimi.isp.net CNAME sel_sign._bimi.isp.net

   For any MUA attempting to validate a signature, this action SHOULD
   fail.  The MBP should rotate keys far ahead of removal of older keys
   so that recent messages are not disassociated with the imagery the
   MBP believes should be displayed.

RFC draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00   BIMI-MUA                  September 2023


   An MUA SHOULD check for revocation daily or upon receipt of the first
   message for a domain.  If the MUA does not intend to display the logo
   for a given message, it MAY NOT check for revocation.  This may
   happen if the MUA only displays the logo when the message is opened
   (vs in the "list view").

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Threat Concerns

   There are a number of concerns relating to how an independent MUA may
   use some of this information, or more important, how an attacker may
   attempt to cause an MUA to improperly display iconography for a user.
   This document is attempting to address these potential attacks.

6.1.1.  Injection of Headers to An Unaware Mailbox Provider

   An attacker could attempt to inject a message via normal SMTP
   methods, howver, the message would contain headers that the MUA may
   believe were added by the receiving Mailbox Provider.

6.1.2.  IMAP Append

   An attacker could insert messages into a mail store via IMAP
   commands, and given a reasonable set of information points could
   induce an MUA to display a logo.

6.1.3.  Signature Replay

6.1.4.  Revocation

6.2.  Key Separation

   The key used to sign these BIMI headers MUST NOT be shared with
   another portion of the receiving platform.

6.3.  Header Removal

   Any MBP receiving these headers intact SHOULD remove these and
   perform their own evaluations.

   NOTE: Ensure that core document specifies the same for BIMI-related
   headers

RFC draft-brotman-bimi-mua-00   BIMI-MUA                  September 2023


6.4.  DNS/Key caching

   Care should be taken not to cache public keys retrieved for an
   excessive amount of time.  It's presumed that the MBP has a good
   reason to revoke the display of related imagery.

   NOTE: Require MUA only retain data for TTL duration?

6.5.  DNS Query Data

   If the MUA queries DNS each time a message is loaded, it's
   conceivable that the DNS server owner could correlate some
   information about a user.  It's not entirely clear if that data could
   be tied to a specific user, or what value this data may have.

7.  Other Considerations

7.1.  Multi-Domain MBP

   There exist a large number of MBPs that accept mail for multiple
   domains.  It could be that there is a primary domain with some side
   aliases, or a large hosting company.  These types of entities may
   wish to explore using a DNAME to link the data between these various
   domains.  One possible solution could be to do something such as:

   _local._bimi.companyA.com DNAME _local._bimi.isp.net

   This would allow for the same sharing of keys, as well as revocation
   information across the domains, while only managing one set of data.

8.  Appendix A

   For purposes below, sending is marketing.example.org, MBP is isp.net,
   and selector is sel_sign.

8.1.  Normal Operational Steps

   *  ESP sends message to MBP containing appropriate headers for BIMI
      usage
   *  MBP performs DKIM/SPF/DMARC steps
   *  Presuming prior step works properly, MBP evaluates BIMI
   *  Based on localized requirements, MBP adds headers to email
      -  BIMI-Location
      -  BIMI-Indicator
   *  MBP additionally adds header specified in this document
      -  BIMI-Receiver-Information
